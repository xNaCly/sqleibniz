    /// Hexadecimal integer literals are interpreted as 64-bit two's-complement integers and are thus limited to sixteen significant digits of precision.
    /// Support for hexadecimal integers was added to SQLite version 3.8.6 (2014-08-15).
    /// For backwards compatibility, the "0x" hexadecimal integer notation is only understood by the SQL language parser, not by the type conversions routines.
    /// String variables that contain text formatted like hexadecimal integers are not interpreted as hexadecimal integers when coercing the string value into an integer due to a CAST expression or for a column affinity transformation or prior to performing a numeric operation or for any other run-time conversions.
    /// When coercing a string value in the format of a hexadecimal integer into an integer value, the conversion process stops when the 'x' character is seen so the resulting integer value is always zero.
